            <li>Personal Background: I have lived in the Charlotte, NC area my entire life, growing up in a small town called Kannapolis. 
                I have 2 siblings, one which is also attending Charlotte, and the other has graduated from the school as well. </li>
            <li>Professional: I am currently working as an IT Intern for the Honors College at UNC Charlotte. I am also actively 
                searching for internships in the software development field.
            <li>Before attending UNC Charlotte, I went to community college for about a year or so. I didn't know what I wanted to do as 
                a career at first, but with my passion for technology, I decided to major in computer science before transferring to Charlotte. </li>
            <li>Background in Web Development: Though I have not taken any college-level courses on web development, I have practiced with 
                several personal projects as well as tutorials. With me alsways being obsessed with computers and technology, coming across HTML, CSS, and 
                JavaScript was bound to happen naturally.
