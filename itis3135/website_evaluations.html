        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://www.apple.com">Apple.com</a></h3>
            <p>This is Apple's site, that dsiplays all of their latest hardware and software. The main homepage will be used for evaulation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast (10/10):</strong> Apple does a good job at grabbing the user's attention with using contrast. Their main color scheme for 
                text and background is black and white, however they make it easy to read by alternating between the two 
                (white background = black text, black background = white text). It also helps that their iPhones are typically colorful, 
                which looks great on a lighter, white background.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Repetition (9/10):</strong> Good repetition is also pevalent throughout Apple's webpage. First off, the same font and color scheme is used
                within the site, and as mentioned before, the white and black adds a simple touch. If you scroll down to where Apple is 
                showing off their latest products, they are using boxes to represent each one. Within each box is the name of the product or service,
                a quick description or expression, and then a picture showing off that product. This makes it easy for the user to understand
                how to get to a specific product without overloading the screen with different graphics and layouts.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Alignment (10/10): </strong> The Alignment also follows Apple's simple website design. Also with the boxes, they are aligned evenly across the page,
                    and is easy to read and navigate.It also have a smooth transition from the first couple sections at the top, to the boxes after.
                    Everything is symmetrical as well as optimized for different screen reader sizes.
                  </li>
               
                <li><strong>Proximity (8/10):</strong> Proximity is also displayed well in Apple's site. All separete information is 
                    placed together without merging a lot of information, and has a simple layout. At the top of the page is Apple's newest, most popular products,
                    Then, in the smaller boxes is information on other products that again separates the content specific to those products.
                    At the bottom of the page is other information and other links throughout the site.</li>


            </ul>

            <h3><a href="https://www.art.yale.edu">Yale School of Art</a></h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast (4/10):</strong> Contrast is a big problem throughout Yale's webpage. There are all types of colors, from different palettes 
                that do not go well with each other, and this makes the webpage unpleasant and confusing to look at. They need to change the colors scheme entirely, 
            or keep certain colors that will go well together.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Repetition (3/10):</strong> Throughout the webpage, different types of font, colors, and shapes are being used. It is hard to understand what is 
                happening on the webpage, as well as how things are supposed to be ordered. For example, at the very top of the page, the font is much smaller 
            than the title of the page, and placed in a weird position. Just like the color scheme, choosing a universal font for this webpage will make 
        it look a little decent, while also keeping the same layout throughout. Also, they should eliminate the graphics from the background, as it makes everything 
    harder to look at.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Alignment (1/10):</strong> Alignment is another big issue with this website. All of the content is pressed up against the 
                left side of the screen, causing a lot of whitespace being made on the right side. Everything is also jumbled up together, with some
            content even spilling over backgrounds because of the difference in sizes of content. An example of this would be the long gray bar that 
        spans across the entire page vertically. Things along this bar tend to run off the border or background, making this gray bar somewhat useless. They should remove this bar, as well as maybe use 
    a flexbox design so that things are not running off of the content, and rather wraping over to the next line.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Proximity (5/10):</strong> As for the proximity within this webpage, everything seems to be spread out in the wrong places. 
                At one point, you have links that people can click such as "log in" or "page history". However these links are on the complete opposite 
            part of another link labeled as "quick links". Also, the "School News" content is not together with all of the news information, and it is hard to read 
        an entire piece of content without stumbling upon something completely unrelated. They need to place each type of content together so that everything is easy to locate and get to. They also need
    to put the links in a separate menu rather than hacing them placed in random places.</li>

            </ul>
